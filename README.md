# WeaponWireTester

**ESP32-based weapon & wire tester for fencing** ‚Äî zero-button UX, fast fault finding, and accurate resistance measurement.  
Supports **body cords** and **weapons** (foil, sabre, √©p√©e). Lam√© continuity is **WIP**.

## Overview

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b0fbee-1a46-4eb2-9e2e-ef7cf60c51a1)

- **Auto mode detection:** No buttons. The tester watches the connectors and switches between **wire test** and **weapon test** automatically.  
- **Intermittent fault capture:** Brief dropouts are latched and displayed for a few seconds.  
- **Clear LED UI:** 5√ó5 WS2812B matrix with intuitive color/status cues.  
- **Power:** USB-C (power bank or USB adapter).

**Connections:**  
- Plug the **enrouleur-side** body-cord plug into the **right** side of the tester, and the **weapon-side** plug into the **left** side.  
- A small hole accommodates the **foil/sabre safety clip**.  
- A small **lam√© patch** on the enclosure allows clipping the crocodile clip.

*(Power via USB-C)*

## Quick start

1. **Power on** via USB-C.  
2. **Connect** a body cord on both sides, or a cord + weapon; the tester selects the mode automatically.  
3. **Wiggle-test** connectors and cable to expose intermittent faults (they‚Äôll be latched briefly).

---

## Operation

### Mode selection (automatic)
- A detected connection **between cord pins** ‚Üí **Wire Test**.  
- A **cord + weapon** combination ‚Üí **Weapon Test** (foil/sabre/√©p√©e detected by wiring).

### Wire testing

**Two phases:**

1) **Quick Check** ‚Äî Fast screening for obvious problems (broken wires, swaps, shorts). An animation highlights faults right-to-left / bottom-to-top.  
2) **Accurate Resistance** ‚Äî Fine measurement; color encodes ohmic range. Move the cable/plug to catch intermittents.

| Display cue        | Meaning                                  | Resistance (Œ©)     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Green solid**     | Good connection                           | **< 3**            |
| **Yellow solid**    | Acceptable / watchlist                    | **3 ‚Äì 5**          |
| **Red solid**       | Out of spec (may still ‚Äúwork‚Äù sometimes)  | **5 ‚Äì 10**         |
| **Red dotted**      | Broken / open                             | **> 10**           |
| **Blue**            | Unintended short between lines            | ‚Äî                  |

### Weapon testing

**Foil & Sabre**
- **Idle:** No lights.  
- **Point pressed / intermittent on either wire:** **White** latched for a few seconds.  
- **Point pressed on lam√©:** **Green** (valid touch).

**√âp√©e**
- **Point pressed:** **Green** (valid touch).  
- **Any wire-to-wire short:** **Blue**.
