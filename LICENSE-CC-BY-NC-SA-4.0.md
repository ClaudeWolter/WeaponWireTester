## Licensor’s NonCommercial Use Policy (Project-Specific Clarification)

**For the avoidance of doubt**, the Licensors interpret “commercial purposes” for this project to **include** the following:

- **Production of more than 10 physical units** in total derived from these design files (including unmodified builds and **remixes/derivatives**), **whether sold or given away**, is **commercial use** and is **not permitted** under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 without a separate commercial license.  
- “Units” include assembled devices, kits, populated or bare PCBs, sub-assemblies, or any physical manifestation of the design.  
- The **10-unit threshold is cumulative per legal entity** (company, organization, or individual) across all variants and remixes of this project within any rolling 12-month period.

**Examples considered NonCommercial (allowed under this license):**
- Personal builds or lab/class projects up to **10 units total** (not sold; cost-sharing OK).  
- A makerspace workshop producing up to **10 units** at cost for members.  
- Prototyping and evaluation up to **10 units**.

**Examples considered Commercial (separate license required):**
- Manufacturing **>10 units** for any purpose (sale, giveaways, pilots, or internal deployment).  
- Integrating the design (or a remix) into a product line totaling **>10 units**.  
- Commissioned production runs **>10 units**, even if not sold.

> This policy clarifies the Licensors’ intent for “NonCommercial” in this project and does not replace the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 legal code below. If your planned use falls near or above the threshold, please request a commercial license.
