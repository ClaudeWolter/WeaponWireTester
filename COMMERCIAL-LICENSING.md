- **Software** (code under `software/`): **Apache License 2.0** *(unchanged)*

## 1) NonCommercial threshold (project-specific clarification)

To avoid ambiguity about “NonCommercial” (NC) under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, the Licensors clarify:

- **Producing more than 10 physical units** derived from these design files—**including unmodified builds and remixes/derivatives**—**whether sold or given away**, is **commercial use** and **not permitted** under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 **without** a separate commercial license.
- “**Units**” include assembled devices, kits, bare or populated PCBs, sub-assemblies, or any physical manifestation of the design.
- The **10-unit threshold is cumulative per legal entity** (company, organization, or individual) across all variants and remixes of this project **within any rolling 12-month period**.

If your intended use is near or above this threshold, please request commercial terms.

---

## 2) Who typically needs a commercial license?

- You plan to **manufacture** and **sell** or distribute more than 10 units per 12-month period.
- You want to **integrate** the design (or a remix) into a commercial product line.
- You are running **pilots, giveaways, or internal deployments** that exceed 10 units.
- You need a **waiver of ShareAlike** and/or **NonCommercial** obligations for your use.

Educational classes, makerspace workshops, or personal builds **≤ 10 units** (not for sale) generally remain within NC.

## 3) How to request a commercial license

**Preferred:** open a GitHub issue in this repository titled:
[Commercial License Request] WeaponWireTester


**Please include:**
- Organization/name and contact person
- Intended use (manufacture, kits, internal deployment, integration, etc.)
- Expected volumes (initial + 12-month forecast)
- Geography and distribution channels
- Whether you seek waivers to **NC** and/or **SA**
- Desired start date/timeline
- Any support/engineering needs

If an issue is unsuitable for your case, propose an alternative contact method in the issue.

> Until a separate commercial agreement is signed, the public **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license (with the >10 unit rule) remains in force.

- **OEM/Integrator License:** for embedding into your product line; may include attribution placement rules.
- **Remix/Derivative License:** permits closed-source derivatives of hardware docs/designs for specified products.

**Financials:** flat fee and/or per-unit royalty.  
**Attribution:** reasonable credit in product docs/website (format negotiable).  
**Support (optional):** paid engineering support, customization, or update channels.  
**Trademarks:** no rights to project names/logos unless expressly granted in writing.  
**Warranties/Liability:** delivered **“AS IS”**; limitations of liability apply (final terms in the agreement).

## 7) FAQs

**Q: Are freebies, pilots, or internal deployments commercial?**  
**A:** If you exceed **10 units** in any rolling 12-month period, **yes**—that’s commercial under our policy, even if units are not sold.

**Q: We’re a school/makerspace. Can we run a class of 12 kits at cost?**  
**A:** Please request a license, or keep to **≤ 10 units**. We try to be friendly to educational use.

**Q: Do remixes/derivatives count toward the 10-unit total?**  
**A:** **Yes.** The threshold is cumulative across variants and remixes derived from this project.

**Q: Does the Apache-2.0 software also require a commercial license?**  
**A:** **No.** Software remains under **Apache-2.0**. The commercial option is for **hardware designs & docs** only.

**Q: Can we use your logos/marks?**  
**A:** Not without explicit written permission; trademarks are separate from copyright.

## 8) Legal notices (summary)

- The public **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license for hardware/docs and **Apache-2.0** for software both provide materials **“AS IS”**, without warranties or conditions of any kind, and with limitations of liability to the maximum extent permitted by law.
- Manufacturing/selling physical goods may trigger additional obligations under applicable laws (e.g., product safety, consumer protection), regardless of the IP license.
