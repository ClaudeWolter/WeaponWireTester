# Code of Conduct — WeaponWireTester

**Repository:** https://github.com/pietwauters/WeaponWireTester  
**Maintainers:** © 2022–2025 Piet Wauters & Claude Wolter

We are a technical project rooted in the world of **fencing**. We expect everyone to act with **fair play, clean sport, respect, and integrity**—on and off the piste.

This Code applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, docs, and any project-affiliated interactions at **tournaments, training venues/salles d’armes, clubs, and activities involving maîtres d’armes, referees, DTs, and SEMI officials**.

---

## Our values

- **Fair play & clean sport.** No tolerance for cheating, equipment tampering, or doping culture. We uphold the spirit and letter of fencing rules.
- **Safety & inclusion.** Foster a welcoming, safe environment for all participants, including youth.
- **Technical integrity.** Seek truth in data, cite sources, reproduce results, and correct mistakes openly.
- **Constructive collaboration.** Be helpful, specific, and kind. Critique ideas, not people.

---

## Alignment with FIE/EFC regulations

- Follow the **FIE Rules** (Material & Technical) and the **EFC rules/statuses**, including guidance from their **SEMI commissions**.  
  - FIE: https://fie.org/fie/documents/rules  
  - EFC: https://www.eurofencing.info/documents/rules-statuses
- When in doubt, defer to event **Directoire Technique (DT)** / **SEMI** decisions and local organizers’ instructions.

---

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful toward athletes, coaches (maîtres d’armes), referees, DTs, volunteers, and contributors.
- Keep feedback **actionable** and **evidence-based**.
- Protect participant safety and privacy; obtain consent before sharing identifiable data/images.
- Disclose conflicts of interest relevant to equipment, vendors, or testing.

---

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, personal attacks; slurs or demeaning comments.
- **Cheating/technical misconduct:** distributing or promoting tools/instructions that falsify signals, bypass weapon control, undermine scoring devices, or defeat rule-mandated tests.
- Doping advocacy, or attempts to normalize rule-breaking that endangers athletes or officials.
- Hateful or violent content; threats; doxing; persistent off-topic spam.

---

## Political plurality & extremist content

We welcome a **plurality of political opinions** while keeping project spaces focused on technical and sporting goals. The following is **not permitted** here:

- Partisan campaigning unrelated to fencing or project objectives.
- Advocacy for, or organizing on behalf of, **far-left or far-right extremist** ideologies/organizations—especially those promoting violence, authoritarianism, or systemic discrimination.
- Symbols, slogans, or propaganda commonly associated with such extremist movements.

> **Note:** Enforcement targets **behavior in project spaces**. We do not police lawful private beliefs; however, accounts primarily used to promote extremist content here may be removed.

---

## Anti-cheating & equipment integrity

- Do **not** use this project to develop, promote, or distribute cheating tools or methods to evade FIE/EFC equipment controls.
- **Responsible disclosure:** If you discover a safety-relevant vulnerability (hardware, firmware, test protocol), report privately (see **Reporting**) and coordinate disclosure with maintainers and, where appropriate, **SEMI** officials.

---

## Scope

This Code covers:
- The GitHub repository, discussions, and documentation.
- Project-affiliated demos, tests, and interactions at **tournaments**, **training venues**, and **clubs** involving maîtres d’armes, referees, DTs, or SEMI.
- Any public representation of the project by maintainers or contributors.

---

## Reporting a concern

If you experience or witness a violation:

- **Email (confidential):** **colloid-nougat-42@icloud.com**  
- **Or** open a minimal **private security advisory** in GitHub requesting CoC review.  
- If necessary, open a public issue titled **“CoC report (redacted)”** with only non-sensitive facts; a maintainer will contact you privately.
- **At events:** where safety or rule integrity is at stake, also inform the **DT/SEMI** on site.

Please include:
- What happened and where (links/screenshots if available)
- When it occurred and whether it is ongoing
- Any prior context or attempts to resolve
- Your preferred contact method

We strive to acknowledge reports within **7 days**.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take actions deemed appropriate. Typical responses:

1. **Correction** — Private note on expected behavior  
2. **Warning** — Official warning  
3. **Temporary restriction** — Mute/limited access/temporary ban  
4. **Permanent ban** — Removal from the community; locking PRs/issues; potential reports to hosts or event organizers

**Appeals:** Request a review by replying to the decision email with new or clarifying information.
