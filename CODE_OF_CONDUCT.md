# Code of Conduct — WeaponWireTester

**Repository:** https://github.com/pietwauters/WeaponWireTester  
**Maintainers:** © 2022–2025 Piet Wauters & Claude Wolter

We are a technical project rooted in the world of **sport**. We expect everyone to act with **fair play, respect, and integrity**—on and off the piste, online and offline.

This Code applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, docs, chats, events, and any official community channel.

---

## Our values

- **Fair play & clean sport.** We do not tolerate cheating, doping culture, equipment tampering, or attempts to subvert safety/rules. We celebrate sportsmanship, transparency, and respect for referees, organizers, and volunteers.
- **Safety & inclusion.** Create a welcoming environment for people of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels.
- **Technical integrity.** Seek truth in data, cite sources, reproduce results, and correct mistakes openly.
- **Constructive collaboration.** Be helpful, specific, and kind. Assume good intent; criticize ideas, not people.

---

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful in language and actions; generously give attribution and credit.
- Keep feedback **actionable** and **evidence-based**.
- Follow venue rules (tournaments, training venues, clubs,...) and protect participants’ safety.
- Disclose conflicts of interest when relevant (e.g., vendor ties).
- Use project resources **ethically** (no backdoors, no test bypasses, no “cheat” features).

---

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks; slurs or demeaning comments.
- Distributing or promoting **cheating tools**, bypassing regulation/safety features, or instructions to defeat equipment control.
- Sexually explicit, violent, or hateful content; threats or incitement to violence.
- Doxing or sharing private information without consent.
- Spamming, derailment, or persistent off-topic promotion.

---

## Political plurality & extremist content

We welcome a **plurality of political opinions** and ask that project spaces remain focused on our technical and sporting goals. The following is **not permitted** in project spaces:

- Partisan campaigning or organizing unrelated to the project’s goals.
- Advocacy for, or organizing on behalf of, far-left or far-right **extremist** ideologies or organizations, particularly those that promote violence, authoritarianism, or systematic discrimination.
- Symbols, slogans, or propaganda commonly associated with such extremist movements.

> **Note:** Enforcement focuses on **behavior within project spaces**. We do not police lawful private beliefs; however, accounts primarily used to promote extremist content here may be removed.

**Working definition (for moderation purposes):** “Far-left/right extremist” refers to movements that reject pluralistic democracy and universal human rights, endorse or justify political violence, or call for the elimination, segregation, or systemic oppression of groups.

---

## Anti-cheating & equipment integrity

- Do **not** use this project to develop, promote, or distribute tools that enable cheating, falsify signals, or bypass weapon control and safety standards.
- Vulnerability reports that pose safety risks should be handled responsibly: report privately first; coordinate disclosure with maintainers and relevant sport bodies when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to:
- All official project venues (GitHub repo, discussions, docs, community chats).
- Official events, workshops, and demos.
- Any public representation of the project by maintainers or contributors.

---

## Reporting a concern

If you experience or witness a violation:

- **Email (confidential):** **cwolter@fencing-efc.eu**  
- **Or** open a minimal **private security advisory** in GitHub and request CoC review.  
- If needed, open a public issue titled **“CoC report (redacted)”** with only necessary, non-sensitive facts; a maintainer will contact you privately.

Please include:
- What happened and where (links/screenshots if available)
- When it happened and whether it is ongoing
- Any prior context or attempts to resolve
- Your preferred contact method

We strive to acknowledge reports within **7 days**.

---

## Enforcement & guidelines

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate. Typical responses (graduated):

1. **Correction** — A private, education-oriented note on expected behavior.  
2. **Warning** — Official warning; continued behavior leads to further action.  
3. **Temporary restriction** — Mute, limited access, or temporary ban from project spaces.  
4. **Permanent ban** — Removal from the community; PRs/issues may be locked; reports to hosting providers or event organizers if needed.

**Appeals:** You may request a review of enforcement decisions by replying to the decision email with new or clarifying information.
